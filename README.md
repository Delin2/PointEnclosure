# PointEnclosure

•	Given an ordered list of points which represent a polygon, return the number of points with integer (x, y) coordinates enclosed by the polygon.

•	Provide a RESTful service which accepts as a POST of JSON an ordered list of points represented as (x, y) coordinates.  The points define the perimeter of a polygon.  
•	Return the number of points with integer (x, y) coordinates which are fully enclosed by the polygon.  Points on the polygon itself are not included in the count – the points to be included in the count must be wholly within the area bounded by the polygon.
